# BetterScp939
An **upgraded** version of the already existing **SCP-939**.

**SCP-939** size has been **reduced by 25%**, it's **faster than humans** and will get **slowed down** after hurting someone.
In return, its **attack** will be **boosted** based on the damage taken.
The adrenaline bar will show how much **angry** it is.

**Credits to Reddking#2021 for the great idea.**
